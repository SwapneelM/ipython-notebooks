# ipython-notebooks
ipython notebooks includes Getting Started instructions for using DataStax Enterprise (DSE) with Spark and ipython notebooks. Check out the "Using ipython notebook..." file
that applies to your OS. There is one for Mac OS X, and one for Ubuntu. 

Use the ipynb files if you already have ipython set up, because they will be interactive.

There are also HTML-rendered versions of the files that can be downloaded and locally viewed. 

matplotlib is just a simple example showing an example of graphing from ipython.

HipsterEffect.ipynb is a file I downloaded to look at more complex graphs, so that you can consider how DSE Spark and ipython notebooks can be applied to your applications.
