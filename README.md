# ipython-notebooks
ipython notebooks mostly holds notebooks that Lorina has created for DSE-Spark interactivity

HipsterEffect.ipynb is an exception - I downloaded this to see more complex graphs

In the html directory, there is a locally-viewable HTML file that gives instructions for setting up ipython notebook with DSE-Spark.
